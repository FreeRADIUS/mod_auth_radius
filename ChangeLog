  Version History
  ===============

  1.6.0  Reformat code, strip out support for Apache < 2.4.  If this is
         required still required, submit patches to add support via
         preprocessor macros.  We will no longer be maintaining per
         version copies of mod_auth_radius.c.

  1.5.4  Support for retries from John Lines <john.lines@integris.co.uk>
         Port to Apache 2.0 by Harrie Hazewinkel <harrie@mod-snmp.com>

  1.5.3 Bug fix from Bryan Stansell <bryan@stansell.org>, to set
        the right data element for the AddRadiusCookieValid configuration
    item.

  1.5.2 Updates for NAS-Identifier and NAS-IP-Address, based on ideas
        from Adrian Hosey <ahosey@systhug.com>.  The NAS-Identifier is
    the virtual server host name, and the NAS-IP-Address is the
    IP address of the base server.

    Also integrated code from http://www.wede.de/sw/mod_auth_radius/
        which had forked form this one after v1.3.3.
