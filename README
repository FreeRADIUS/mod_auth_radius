  Introduction
  ============

  Everyone wants strong authentication over the web.  For us, this means
RADIUS.

  Using static passwords & RADIUS authentication over the web is a BAD
IDEA.  Everyone can sniff the passwords, as they're sent over the net
in the clear.  RADIUS web authentication is a REALLY BAD IDEA if you
use the same RADIUS server for web and NAS (dial-up) or firewall
users.  Then ANYONE can pretend to be you, and break through your
firewall with minimal effort.

  PLEASE use a different RADIUS server for web authentication and
dial-up or firewall users!  If you must use the same server, go for
one-time passwords.  They're ever so much more secure.

  Also, do NOT have your RADIUS server visible to the external world.
Doing so makes all kinds of attacks possible.


  Configuration
  =============

  See the example 'httpd.conf' in this directory for a detailed example
of the configuration directives.

  You must have at least one authentication method as authoritative.  If
they all return "DECLINED", you get a "server configuration error"
message.

  AddRadiusAuth configures the RADIUS server name (and optional port).
You must also specify the shared secret, and tell the RADIUS server
that the web host machine is a valid RADIUS client.  The optional
<seconds> field specifies how long Apache waits before giving up, and
deciding that the RADIUS server is down.  It then returns a "DENIED"
error.

  If you want, you can specify how long the returned cookies are valid.
The time is in minutes, with the magic value of '0' meaning forever.


  The per-dir configuration Cookie Valid time does NOT over-ride the
server configuration.  mod_auth_radius choose the most restrictive of
the two to use.  This way, a site administrator can say all cookies
are valid forever, and then make some directories a bit more secure,
by forcing re-authentication every hour.

  If you want logging, use the standard Apache access log.  A log
message is generated ONLY when a user has authenticated, and their
name & file accessed is put in the log file.


  How it works
  ============

The browser requests a page: http://www.example.com/index.html

Apache notes that the directory is access controlled, and sends a
"Authorization Required".

The browser asks for a username & password, which it then sends to
Apache, along with a request for the page again.

Apache calls mod_auth_radius, which notes that there is no RADIUS
cookie in the request.

mod_auth_radius packages up the username/password into a RADIUS
request, and sends it to the RADIUS server.

The RADIUS server does its magic, and decides yes/no for
authentication.

If no, mod_auth_radius returns DENIED.

If yes, mod_auth_radius returns a cookie containing MD5'd
public+private information.

The web browser uses this cookie on all subsequent requests, and
mod_auth_radius verifies the cookie is valid, and doesn't contact the
RADIUS server again.


  Some warnings
  =============

  This works fine for static passwords (i.e. "user", "password"), but
needs a bit more attention for one-time passwords.  All of the
browsers I've tested don't use the cookie immediately if you're
accessing a directory as:

http://www.example.com/

What's hidden here is that the following files are checked for:

http://www.example.com/
http://www.example.com/home.html
http://www.example.com/home.cgi
http://www.example.com/index.cgi
http://www.example.com/index.html

  etc., all in sequence.  This module does a 'stat', and returns "NOT
FOUND" when anyone tries to access a file which doesn't exist.
However, it WILL authenticate for a file which does exists, but the
browser may not use the returned cookie when accessing a different
page.

The way to fix this is to point the browser at a specific page. i.e.

http://www.example.com/

  Which points to the page 'index.html' (or similar).  That file
should contain text which says "connect to our _secure_ site", where
_secure_ is a link to a specific *page*, not a *directory*.  e.g.

http://www.example.com/secure/index.html

  If you do not add in 'index.html' in the link, it won't work
properly.

  This method ensures that users are only authenticated once for the
secure pages, and not multiple times.

  People using static passwords don't need to do this, but if they
don't, they'll notice that their RADIUS server is getting 1-4 hits for
every web authentication request.


  Some browsers (I.E.) have a problem with sending cookies on initial
requests. If you have a file index.html which includes img/foo.gif in
the same directory.  The user authenticates, reads index.html (with
the cookie in the request header), BUT on reading the gifs, the cookie
is NOT included.

  This problem can be avoided by EITHER putting the gifs in the same
directory as the index.html file, or putting moving the entire tree
down a node, and having a NEW index.html which points to
./moved/index.html This is ridiculously ugly, but it seems to work.


  About the cookies
  =================

  The cookies are valid for a specified time, or until the browser
dies.  mod_auth_radius will forcibly try to expire cookies that it
thinks are too old.  If your browser doesn't expire the cookie, you'll
see an authorization required message over and over.  You must then
exit the browser, and re-load the web page.


  Challenge-Response support
  ==========================

  As of 1.2.1, this module supports the full RADIUS challenge-response
mechanism.  From the user's perspective, on authenticatation, type in
username & garbage (or NUL) password.  Click <OK>, and you'll get an
authentication failure.  This is fine, as mod_auth_radius has secretly
set a cookie, and modified the Basic-Authentication-Realm.

  When the authentication fails, click <OK> to continue, and you'll
get another username/password authentication window.  This time,
however, you'll see your username displayed, along with the RADIUS
Reply-Message at the top of the authentication window.  This message
usually includes a challenge.

  Type in your username, and put the response to the challenge in the
password field.  Click <OK> again, and you should be authenticated.

  The secret is that cookies are being magically set back and forth,
and these cookies include the RADIUS state variable.

  The challenge-response works on Netscape 3.x and 4.x, HotJava, but
NOT on Internet Explorer.  I.E. does not appear to follow the relevant
RFCs properly.
